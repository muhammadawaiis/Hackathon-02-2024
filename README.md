Project Description
This project is a web-based application built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It features a modern and responsive design with optimized performance for seamless user experience.

Approach
1.Planning and Design

Carefully analyzed the project requirements and created a user-centric layout.
Designed reusable components for efficient scalability and code management.

2.Development

Leveraged Next.js for server-side rendering and routing, ensuring fast loading times.
Used Tailwind CSS for streamlined styling and responsiveness.
Organized images in the /public/images folder and implemented best practices for asset management.

3.Functionality

Built interactive UI elements using React's state management.
Integrated navigation with Next.js <Link> for smooth transitions between pages.
Ensured compatibility across different screen sizes.

4.Deployment

Deployed the application on Vercel, ensuring high availability and optimized performance.
Addressed deployment-specific challenges such as image rendering and asset path configurations.
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
